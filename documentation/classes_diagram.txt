class Interferogram {
{field} reads data from the picture
{field} contains data on the 1 layer 
{field} navigation 
{field} allows changing scale
{field} allows modifying some pixels (noise, random emissions)
}

class Lines { 
{field} contains information about lines on the 2 layer (coordinates of basic points, direction of lines)
{field} allows modifying lines, number and positions of basic points
}

class Phases { 
{field} contains phase map and allows to show it on the 3 layer
}
class Density { 
{field} contains density map and allows to show it on the 4 layer
}

class Tracer {
{field} creates lines
}
class Phaser {
{field} creates phase map
}
class Densifier { 
{field} creates density map
}
